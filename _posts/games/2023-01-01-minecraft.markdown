I have been modding Minecraft for nearly 10 years now! It was originally how I got into programming, and certainly doesn't feel like that long ago! I started off with basic mods, learning from YouTube tutorials and basically mimicing them until I got a good understanding of how things actually worked.

This was the first mod that I made fully myself, the Amethyst mod! I was obsessed with adding new tool materials back then for some reason. Some time later, after more learning I released the first version of CompactStorage, a mod I still maintain to this day! The first version was very basic and only had 4 different sizes of chests.

## CompactStorage

This was very basic and soon grew into something completely different, I ended up going for variable sizing of chests. In its first iteration this took the form of the Chest Builder. This worked as a sort of Crafting Table for Compact Chests. You picked a size and it gave you a list of ingredients that were required for that size, then once you met the requirements you could build your chest.

This also saw the introduction of backpacks, which were a challenge at first but over time came to be one of the mods selling points. I've experimented with different types of blocks and items before but never found anything to fit the mod quite as well as the current set of features. After 1.7.10 there was a bit of a change of pace with development because I was at university. Through 1.12 - 1.16 the mod definitely felt neglected but after I finished up with uni I had a bit more time to work on it so 1.18+ has had a bit more love. 

Post 1.16 the Chest Builder was retired in favour of Chest Upgrades, these are items you can craft to give the chest more horizontal / vertical space. Barrels were also added into the mod at this point, alongside a full rewrite to give compatibility with both Forge and Fabric. That has certainly been one of the hardest things to maintain and I've recently been looking into a better solution to keep both up to date! For now, that is where the mod is up to. I certainly do have new ideas for the mod but I'm not too sure what I want to do with it yet.

## Horizontal Glass Panes
Horizontal Glass Panes is on of my smaller mods, it only has horizontal versions of all of the vanilla glass panes to allow things like skylights to be made. It was originally written in Scala as a way for me to learn a new language, it has since moved to Java and has been updated for 1.19 Forge and Fabric. Because of how small it is, it is very easy to update and usually gets done before CompactStoage to allow me to learn any changes before taking on the larger mod! It's been around for quite a while but remains very simple and has very much been focused on allowing me to learn whilst also producing something that has some functionality!
