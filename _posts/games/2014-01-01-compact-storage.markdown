I have been modding Minecraft for nearly 10 years now! It was originally how I got into programming, and certainly doesn't feel like that long ago! I started off with basic mods, learning from YouTube tutorials and basically mimicing them until I got a good understanding of how things actually worked. In that time I have amassed over 14 million downloads across my mods, crazy right! I released the first version of CompactStorage in 2014, a mod I still maintain to this day! The first version was very basic and only had 4 different sizes of chests.

This was very basic and soon grew into something completely different, I ended up going for variable sizing of chests. In its first iteration this took the form of the Chest Builder. This worked as a sort of Crafting Table for Compact Chests. You picked a size and it gave you a list of ingredients that were required for that size, then once you met the requirements you could build your chest.

This also saw the introduction of backpacks, which were a challenge at first but over time came to be one of the mods selling points. I've experimented with different types of blocks and items before but never found anything to fit the mod quite as well as the current set of features. After 1.7.10 there was a bit of a change of pace with development because I was at university. Through 1.12 - 1.16 the mod definitely felt neglected but after I finished up with uni I had a bit more time to work on it so 1.18+ has had a bit more love. 

Post 1.16 the Chest Builder was retired in favour of Chest Upgrades, these are items you can craft to give the chest more horizontal / vertical space. Barrels were also added into the mod at this point, alongside a full rewrite to give compatibility with both Forge and Fabric. Post 1.20, Forge support was dropped in favour of NeoForge and new wooden chests, barrels and item drums were added. I'm not sure where I want to take this project next but I'm actively exploring new ideas!
