Other than CompactStorage, I have a few other mods that I tinker around with. Horizontal Glass Panes was the first of these and was originally a project to allow me to learn *Scala*, this was dropped in favour of Java and I have been updating it since its release, and it is currently on 1.21. Other than that, I have made a few other mods such as *Slabify*, a mod that allows the player to craft slabs, stairs, fences and carpets of any block in the game (within limits) this has not been updated currently as I am reevaluating the project. I also made a mod called *Mo' Crafting Tables* that added crafting tables for all the different wood types, alongside slab variants of them all. I also added Crafting Tables that keep their items when leaving the UI, allowing for multiple players to craft at once. Again, this project is on hiatus right now whilst I reevaluate my mods! Watch this space!
