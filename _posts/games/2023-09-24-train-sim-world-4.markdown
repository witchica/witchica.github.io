I began working on Train Sim World 4 shortly after joining Dovetail Games, my main task was the creation of the <i>EMD F125</i> locomotive featured as part of the Antelope Valley line. This was my first full locomotive so this was a large undertaking for me, however, this gave me a wide set of skills across the board. The F125 turned out really well and for my first train I'm very happy with how it came together. I worked cross-department a lot more as part of this project, communicating with the art and audio team about different aspects of the project. Specifically, audio ties in with the simulation quite heavily so quite a lot of work goes into giving them the right things (we even have ladder climbing sounds! woo!).

Other work I undertook for TSW 4 included generic bug fixing, within my own route I took over later stages of the Rotem cars. As well as helping on other routes, predominantly the East Coast Mainline. I took over the Passenger Information Displays later in the project and developed the fonts and functionalities further for both of these systems. I'm really happy with how they turned out and it adds a little bit of extra realism to the product.
