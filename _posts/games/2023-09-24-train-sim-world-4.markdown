I began working on Train Sim World 4 shortly after joining Dovetail Games, my main task for the summer release was the creation of the <i>EMD F125</i> locomotive featured as part of the Antelope Valley line. This was my first full locomotive so this was a large undertaking for me, however, this gave me a wide set of skills across the board. The F125 turned out really well and for my first train I'm very happy with how it came together. I worked cross-department a lot more as part of this project, communicating with the art and audio team about different aspects of the project. Specifically, audio ties in with the simulation quite heavily so quite a lot of work goes into giving them the right things (we even have ladder climbing sounds! woo!).

Other work I undertook for Train Sim World 4 before release included generic bug fixing, within Antelope Valley I took over later stages of the Rotem cars. As well as helping on other routes, predominantly the East Coast Mainline. I took over the Passenger Information Displays later in the project and developed the fonts and functionalities further for both of these systems. I'm really happy with how they turned out and it adds a little bit of extra realism to the product. 

Throughout the life of Train Sim World 4, I worked across mutliple different projects in both content creation and bugfixing. The digital display system from the *F125* had more work done on it by both me and my lead, and was later implemented as the core screen system within the game, this was then used across all future routes and is still being worked on to bring more complex features to train screens. This was first used in the *Maintalbahn BR642* which I developed the digital displays for. I then worked on the *Semmeringbahn OBB 1116* on both vehicle setup and digital displays and I am really proud of how that project turned out.

 Towards the end of Train Sim World 4, I worked heavily on the *Class 380* DLC for the Cathcart Circle line. Being from Scotland, this DLC excited me and working on it was super fun. I put a lot of time into the digital displays on the *Class 380* whilst also completing the vehicle setup from start to finish. This DLC was very well received and still has a **100% review score** on Steam with specific mentions to the accuracy of the train and its systems, as well as a lot of comments about how much functionality the screens have! I am super proud of my work on this DLC and it helped me feel confident in the skills I have developed over my time at Dovetail.
