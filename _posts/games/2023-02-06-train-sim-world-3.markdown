Working for Dovetail Games on the Traim Sim World series has been amazing and is a super exciting role for me. I've always loved trains so having the opportunity to work on a train simulator has been truly amazing. In my first 6 months with Dovetail I have mainly been learning how things work and gaining experience with Unreal Engine, so far I have worked on 3 main projects which has been an amazing learning opportunity for me. A lot of the work I have done so far has been bug fixing on existing content as a learning experience on how things go together.

My actual role is within the Rail Vehicle Setup team as an Assistant Technical Designer, which is pretty much exactly what it sounds like! My day to day tasks usually involve researching real world locomotives, wagons and coaches and implementing that functionality into the game. This mainly involves setting up all of the controls that the train would have, building the logic to support these using Blueprint and implementing some of the simulation logic! Along the way there is a large chunk of documentation and scouring manuals to find how things work! The main goal is to replicate the real world functionality whilst still giving a fun and intuitive user experience. This role has also given me a chance to get to grips with Unreal Engine, as previously most of my experience was with Unity. 

I'm sure as time goes on I will have a lot more to say about what I get up to and give updates on how things are going, but for now it's just learning and working away! I really enjoy working at Dovetail and I can't wait to see what the future holds for me there.
