Working for Dovetail Games on the Traim Sim World franchise has been amazing and is a super exciting role for me. I've always loved trains so having the opportunity to work on a train simulator has a dream for me. I have recently been promoted from Assistant Technical Designer to Technical Designer Level 1. My most recent development work has been on the <i>Class 700</i> DLC. I mainly worked on the passenger information and cab screens featured within this train. This project was super fun as this train is local to me, I gathered reference and put together the widgets to be as accurate as possible. This DLC currently has an 89% customer satisfaction score on Steam. Featured on this page is a demonstration of the screens and how they work, check it out! I am now mainly working on new content for the game, which is super exciting as it gives me the chance to develop my skills within Unreal engine even further.

Prior to this, I had been working mainly on older projects to apply bug fixes and improvements where needed. This allowed me to gain an understanding of how everything got put together within the game. My main tasks are researching trains, reading through their manuals and applying that knowledge to create the same functions within Unreal Engine. This involves a lot of documentation as other teams need to reference our work to put everything together! The main goal is to replicate the real world functionality whilst still giving a fun and intuitive user experience. This role has also given me a chance to get to grips with Unreal Engine, as previously most of my experience was with Unity. 

I'm sure as time goes on I will have a lot more to say about what I get up to and give updates on how things are going, but for now it's just learning and working away! I really enjoy working at Dovetail and I can't wait to see what the future holds for me there.
