Train Sim World 5 allowed me to further develop a lot of the skills I had been working towards, with a big focus on developing my vehicle simulation skills. I was able to assist on some wagons and coaches for the new release, as well as observing more complex simulation for locomotives. My primary focus was on the locomotives for *Kinzigtalbahn* and I spent time across a wide range of vehicles during the development process. I later took on more responsibility for the setup of the *Class 390* which is part of the Deluxe Edition for *West Coast Mainline*. This was a super exciting project as the 390 is a very advanced train, I got to demonstrate my understanding of the games systems and learn more about more complex vehicles. I further developed my understanding of digital display systems and made further improvements to the underlying tech that powers them. Overall working on Train Sim World 5 helped me strengthen my skillset and work towards learning new skills, I'm excited to see what I'll be working on in the future!
